I'm currently struggling with empty nest syndrome. Both my kids are off to college, and the house feels eerily quiet. For years, I built my world around them—driving to soccer games, helping with homework, making meals. Now I walk past their rooms and feel this ache of absence. I’m proud of them, truly, but I miss being needed. I’m trying to rediscover myself again, outside of being a mom. It’s exciting and heartbreaking all at once.
