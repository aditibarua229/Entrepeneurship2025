I'm currently struggling with coping with aging and physical limitations. My body doesnâ€™t do what it used to. Walking hurts, climbing stairs is a challenge, and I feel like my world is shrinking. I hate asking for help. I used to be the strong one, the provider. Now I feel like a burden. Aging is humbling in ways I never imagined. I try to stay optimistic, but I miss feeling capable and in control.
