I'm currently struggling with divorce and rebuilding life. I never thought I’d be here at 26, starting over. I gave years to someone who ultimately didn’t value me. Now I’m learning to live alone, to trust again, to remember who I was before them. It’s lonely, but oddly empowering. Every day I rebuild a little—my confidence, my routine, my dreams. Some days it’s hard to get out of bed, but other days I surprise myself with my strength.
