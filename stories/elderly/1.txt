I'm currently struggling with balancing work and family life. I love my job, but it consumes me. My kids are growing up, and I feel like I’m missing it. The guilt eats at me—when I’m at work, I think about home; when I’m home, I think about work. My partner is supportive, but I know they’re overwhelmed too. I thought I could do it all, but I’m learning that “balance” isn’t a state—it’s a constant juggle. And I’m tired.
