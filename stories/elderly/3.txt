I'm currently struggling with career burnout and seeking change. I’ve been in the same field for 20 years, and it’s draining me. I used to love this work, but now every day feels like I’m on autopilot. I fantasize about quitting and starting over, but that idea is both thrilling and terrifying. I have responsibilities, a mortgage, a family. What if I fail? But what if I keep living like this and lose myself completely?
