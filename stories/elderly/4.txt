I'm currently struggling with caring for aging parents. My dad has dementia, and my mom is exhausted. I’m the only child nearby, so the responsibility falls on me. It’s emotionally and physically exhausting. I want to be there for them, but I also have my own life, my own family. Guilt is a constant companion. I don’t want to see them suffer, but I’m not sure how much more I can give without breaking down.
