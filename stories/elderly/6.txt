I'm currently struggling with financial stress and retirement planning. The older I get, the more I worry about the future. I feel like I’m running out of time to “get it together.” I don’t have much saved, and the cost of living keeps rising. Retirement feels less like a destination and more like a cliff. I lie awake some nights doing mental math, wondering what will happen if I get sick, if I lose my job, if the market crashes. It’s exhausting.
