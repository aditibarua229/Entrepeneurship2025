I'm currently struggling with loneliness and finding connection. My kids have moved out, and my partner passed away five years ago. I used to think loneliness was a quiet evening. Now I know it’s a constant echo, a silence that follows you everywhere. I’ve tried joining clubs and going to community events, but most people already have their circles. Sometimes I go days without speaking to anyone. I didn’t expect aging to feel so invisible.
