I'm currently struggling with health issues and diagnosis. A few months ago, I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. It flipped my life upside down. I used to be active, energetic. Now I wake up in pain, unsure of what my body will allow me to do. It’s hard to explain this to friends who still live life full-speed. I don’t want pity—I want understanding. I want hope. But right now, all I feel is fear.
