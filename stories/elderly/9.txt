I'm currently struggling with loss of a loved one. My brother passed away unexpectedly, and I haven’t been the same since. Grief comes in waves—sometimes crashing, sometimes quietly pulling me under. People expect you to “move on,” but I don’t think I ever will. I’m learning to live with the ache, to carry it without letting it consume me. But some days, I just want to scream.
