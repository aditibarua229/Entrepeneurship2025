I'm currently struggling with feeling left behind compared to peers. I see people my age getting internships, winning competitions, or already planning their futures, and I feel like I’m standing still. Social media only makes it worse—everyone seems so successful while I’m stuck battling self-doubt. I know comparison is a thief of joy, but it’s hard to stop. I’m trying to remind myself that I’m on my own path, and that’s okay. It’s hard not to let the pressure eat away at my confidence though.
