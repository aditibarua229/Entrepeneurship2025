I'm currently struggling with financial independence and budgeting. Living on my own sounded liberating at first, but rent, bills, and groceries quickly turned that excitement into stress. I make just enough to get by, but there’s never room for savings or fun. I feel embarrassed asking my parents for help. There’s this societal expectation that by now I should have everything figured out, but I don’t. Every dollar I spend feels like a potential mistake. I wish someone had taught us about money management in school. I'm learning as I go, but the anxiety remains.
