I'm currently struggling with deciding on a career path. I graduated recently and now face a terrifying level of freedom. I can do anything, but that also means I have no idea where to start. Every option feels like the wrong one, or like I’m giving up on other parts of myself. I change my mind daily—law, writing, marketing, even teaching. I want to do something meaningful, but I’m afraid of choosing poorly and wasting time. There’s this pressure to get it “right,” and it’s paralyzing.
