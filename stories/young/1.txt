I'm currently struggling with mental health issues like depression or anxiety. It's been a daily battle where I wake up questioning my decisions and wondering if I'm on the right path. Depression has affected every part of my life. Iâ€™ve tried talking to friends and family, but it often feels like they don't fully understand. Sometimes I just want to escape from it all, but I know I have to keep going. I'm learning slowly to cope, but it's not easy. Every day is a lesson in patience, resilience, and learning to be kind to myself.
