I'm currently struggling with identity and purpose. I’m still trying to figure out who I am. Sometimes I feel like I’m just a reflection of what others expect from me. I switch masks constantly—at school, at home, online. I don’t know what’s real. Everyone says I’ll “find myself,” but how? And when? The pressure to define myself feels too heavy. I want to matter. I want to understand myself. But most days, I just feel lost.
