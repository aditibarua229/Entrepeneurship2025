I'm currently struggling with pressure from parents to succeed. They want the best for me, but their version of success doesn’t always align with mine. I feel like I’m living their dream instead of mine. They want me to be a doctor, but I want to be an artist. Every conversation ends in guilt or disappointment. I want to make them proud, but I also want to be happy. Balancing those two feels impossible. I’m scared that no matter what I choose, someone ends up hurt—including me.
