I'm currently struggling with relationship heartbreak and healing. It’s been several months since we broke up, but the emptiness still lingers. I keep revisiting conversations, wondering what I could’ve done differently. My mind constantly replays our happiest memories, and that makes it even harder to move on. I know healing isn't linear, and yet I punish myself for not being over it already. Everyone says time heals, but time just feels like a dull ache stretched out endlessly. I’m trying to focus on rebuilding my self-worth, one day at a time.
