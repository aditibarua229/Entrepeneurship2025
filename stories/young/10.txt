I'm currently struggling with college stress and choosing a major. I’m torn between what I love and what’s “practical.” I enjoy literature, but everyone warns me about job prospects. So I’m stuck in business classes that drain me. My GPA matters, internships matter, everything matters—and it’s exhausting. I’m terrified of making a decision I’ll regret. I want to pursue passion, but fear the consequences. It feels like no choice is safe.
