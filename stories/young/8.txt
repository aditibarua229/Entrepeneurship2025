I'm currently struggling with social anxiety and making friends. I moved to a new city for work and suddenly realized how hard adult friendships are. I crave connection but fear rejection. I rehearse what I’ll say before every conversation and still walk away feeling like I messed it up. I miss the ease of school friendships. Now it feels like everyone already has their group and I’m just orbiting. I want to belong somewhere, but I don’t know how to begin.
