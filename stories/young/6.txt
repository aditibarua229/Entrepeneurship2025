I'm currently struggling with body image and self-esteem. I've never really liked how I look, but lately, it’s been affecting me more deeply. I avoid mirrors, dodge photos, and dread social events. Every outfit feels like a battle between hiding and pretending to feel confident. Even compliments feel hollow. I know I’m more than my appearance, but the mirror feels louder than logic. I’m working on unlearning these toxic standards and practicing gratitude for what my body does rather than how it looks—but it’s hard.
